## Project Description
**Effect of the Economical Environment on the Preferences of Car Makes a Consumer Purchases**

## Project Summary
When the economic environment is turbulent it can cause consumers to be more frugal. With automobile purchases being a large purchase, this frugality should be apparent. The project looks to help understand the relationship between the economical environment (crypto currency like Bitcoin/ Ethereum and stock market prices of automakers) and the effects they have on total car sales value per day. This may expose relationships that are typically hidden in quarterly reports or other business paperwork that lags how entities are doing. Showing the association of crypto/ stock market price percent change to the average sales of car makes, could show if certain car makers are more prone to these daily sales comparisons.

## Virtual Environment
Run the requirements.txt to simulate the running environment that the team used for developing the code to gather insights about the project.

### requirements.txt
Can create a virtualpython environments and have it call all of the dependency in one pip install
#### Using a requirements.txt 
https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-pip-install-requirements/
- Make sure the requirements.txt is in your working directory or point at it.
- pip install -r requirements.txt

####Create a requirements.txt
https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-package-version/
- pip freeze
- Copy and paste the contents for the return into a requirements.txt file

### Python environments
Allows for keepingyour python working space to be isolated from other setups and allows forletting other people to use the setup to ensure their environment matches andshould work the way it did for the original programmer.
